    Awesome, you've authorized Feverdream to publish to
    {{site.domain}} (Don't worry we won't do anything without your
    permission). We're halfway there. Now let's convince a Micropub
    client to post to Feverdream.
  </p>

  <p>
    Micropub clients look for links (either &lt;link> or &lt;a>) on
    your site's homepage that tell them how to get authorization and
    how to post to the site. The Micropub protocol allows for each
    step in this process to be handled by a different service, which
    makes it super easy to write new clients. But it means we have to
    add a few tags instead of just one.

  <div id="indieauth-instructions">
    <p>
      First we'll add support
      for <a href="https://indieauth.com">IndieAuth</a> if you don't
      already have it by adding one or more <code>rel="me"</code>
      links to your homepage.

&lt;a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/karathrace"&gt;@karathrace on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a rel="me" href="https://github.com/starbuck"&gt;starbuck on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;

    <p>Next we'll add a few tags to tell micropub clients which
    services to use for authorization and publishing.</p>

&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token"&gt;
